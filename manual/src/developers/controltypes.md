## Scrollable lists
A long touch (longer than 0.5sec) on a control will show up a window with a large version of the control. Lists have been reworked so that they become swipeable containers of list items. We would like to get close to tablet-like behavior.

## Lists with bitmap data
A picture is worth of thousand words. Often it is hard to describe a list item with words. For those situations, we added a way to provide graphical bitmap data. The idea is at its very beginning, but feel it is an important addition that needs to be developed further.

## Pads
Pads are primarily meant to trigger notes, act as on/off switches, or selectors of predefined values. They can be configured either as momentary switches or toggles.

## Vertical faders
Vertical faders are equivalents of horizontal faders. Although they can be assigned to pots, their true value might be fact that their values can be modified with on-screen touch.

## Dials
Many people asked about these. We are still not convinced if they are really needed.

## ADSR envelope
The envelope may have one of its parameters assigned to a pot. On long touch, a detail window is shown and provides access to all envelope parameters.

Provides the same functionality as ADSR, but for ADR envelope.

## DX7 (multi-stage) envelope
Provides the same functionality as ADSR, but for DX7 multi-stage envelope.

## Macro
With version 2 it is possible to assign one pot to several controls. In such situation, turning the pot will affect the values of all assigned controls.
