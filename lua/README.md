# Electra One Lua Extension

Examples of using the [Lua Extension](https://docs.electra.one/developers/ctrllua.md) in Electra One presets.

Each example is described in the [Lua Extension Tutorials](https://docs.electra.one/tutorials/luaext.md).

## Firmware
Firmware 1.5.12 or later is required to run the examples.

## Uploading the examples
Each example consits of two files, the preset and the Lua extension file. Both files must be uploaded to the same preset slot on the controller. This can be done by sending appropriate SysEx messages or using the [Development sandbox editor](https://beta.electra.one/sandbox).

## Examples

1. [Hello MIDI world!](01_helloworld)
